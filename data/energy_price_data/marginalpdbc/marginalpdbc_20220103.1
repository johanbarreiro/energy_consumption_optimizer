Servers
Average annual power may be around 1,800 to 1,900 kWh every year per server (divide by 365 then 24 the 4) 0.05279680365 kWh per 15 minutes

Network Switch
However, as a general estimate, a non-PoE 24 port switch may consume around 20-50 watts of power, while a PoE-enabled switch may consume around 100-250 watts or more, depending on the power requirements of the connected devices. PoE: 25Wh - 62.5Wh per 15 minutes Non-PoE: 5Wh - 12.5Wh per 15 minutes

HDD & SDD 
Depending on disk size, an HDD can use anywhere from 6 to 9 watts at maximum capacity. While this is lower than in previous years, power requirements for SSDs have remained mostly constant at around 6 watts per disk.
HDD: 0.175Wh - 0.2625Wh per 15 minutes SSD: 0.175Wh per 15 minutes
