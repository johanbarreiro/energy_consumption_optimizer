    "\t•\tC = Power allocated to charging transport vehicles - Controllable. This variable allows you to manage when and how much power is used for charging vehicles, optimizing energy usage without impacting production operations.\n",
    "\t•\tP = Production Schedule - Given. This reflects the operational capacity utilization, influencing energy needs based on how much of the plant’s machinery is in use.\n",
    "\t•\tM = Machine Maintenance Status - Given. Well-maintained machines operate more efficiently, using less energy. Poor maintenance can lead to increased energy consumption.\n",
